# Global Groundwater FHE Analysis

A privacy-centric platform enabling hydrological institutions worldwide to securely share encrypted groundwater level data. Leveraging fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), the platform allows collaborative analysis and predictions on global groundwater depletion trends while ensuring that raw data remains confidential.

## Project Motivation

Global water scarcity is a pressing concern, and comprehensive groundwater monitoring requires collaboration across countries. Traditional data sharing faces multiple challenges:

* Data sensitivity: Nations and institutions may be reluctant to share raw groundwater data.
* Privacy concerns: Individual aquifer data can be sensitive for local communities.
* Limited predictive power: Aggregated datasets often lack precision due to incomplete reporting.

Our platform addresses these challenges by enabling:

* Secure encrypted sharing of groundwater measurements.
* FHE-based collaborative computations without revealing raw data.
* Transparent aggregation and predictive insights on global groundwater trends.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

* **Encrypted Data Submission**: Institutions submit groundwater level readings fully encrypted.
* **FHE-based Computation**: Analyses and predictions are conducted on encrypted data without decryption.
* **Region Aggregation**: Counts and summaries per region while preserving privacy.
* **Immutable Storage**: All submissions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.

### Privacy & Security

* **Client-side Encryption**: Data is encrypted before submission.
* **Full Anonymity**: No institution-specific identifiers are exposed.
* **Immutable Records**: Once submitted, data cannot be altered or deleted.
* **Encrypted Analytics**: Aggregation and trend predictions operate entirely on encrypted datasets.

### Predictive Insights

* **Global Depletion Trends**: Predict areas at risk of water scarcity.
* **Threshold Monitoring**: Identify regions approaching critical groundwater levels.
* **Visualization Ready**: Decrypted summaries available for reporting while raw data remains confidential.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

* **GroundwaterFHE.sol** (deployed on Ethereum)

  * Handles submission of encrypted groundwater data.
  * Maintains immutable records on-chain.
  * Tracks region-based statistics using encrypted counters.
  * Facilitates decryption requests securely with FHE.

### Frontend Application

* **React + TypeScript**: Responsive user interface for data submission and monitoring.
* **Ethers.js**: Handles interactions with Ethereum contracts.
* **Real-time Dashboard**: Visualize aggregated groundwater levels and regional statistics.
* **Search & Filter**: Easily locate specific regions or datasets.

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain & FHE

* **Solidity ^0.8.24**: Smart contract development.
* **FHE Library**: Supports encrypted computation over submitted datasets.
* **Sepolia Testnet**: Current deployment environment.

### Frontend
